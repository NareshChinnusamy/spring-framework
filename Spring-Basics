Spring Framework Guru - 5

Section 1 : Building a Spring Boot Web App : (Branch - feature/spring-framework)
1.created spring framework project in github.
2.Added required dependencies of spring boot starter web, jpa, test, java persistence, thymeleaf requirements.
3.Created Entity class with entity anotation and setup the mapping like many to many, one to many, many to one.

Section 2:  Dependency Injection with Spring : (Branch - feature/dependency-injection-ioc)
1.Dependency Injection and IOC Basics
2.Dependency Injection without spring(Using Junit5 tests by setting up using property type injection, setter, constructor type injection)
3.Using Application Context to get bean of specified container in sprintbootapplication class instead of instantiate spring framework will take care of this.
4.Instantiate different type of controllers in main spring boot class using dependency injection annotations(@controller, @service, @Autowired)
5.Constructor based dependency injection doesn't require @Autowired annotations
